    - All
    - folder1: test
    - folder2: test
5. Choose "folder2: test".

4. There should be 3 visible entries:
    - folder1: test
    - folder1: folder1-shell
    - folder2: test
    - folder2: folder2-shell
5. Choose "folder1: folder1-shell"

Expected:
Based on the npm configuration the output will be different, but the terminal should return value from `npm config get shell`, e.g. `/bin/bash`.
